Body width: 80%
Fonts:
  - Poiret One for navbar and headings
  - Open Sans for paragraphs and everything else

Color scheme:
Each section will have its own color, so that when you are on the home page it
is a shade of green, and then past projects is red. This will also be reflected
in the navbar, so when you hover over a specific section in the navbar, it will
be the same color as the background on that section. So the colors will be

Banner:
  - We are considering having a very basic banner, that has a menu button that
  shows the navbar and the Lydmurerlosjen logo. Either this banner will be in white
  with no border, or the border will be very thin with a shadow that is created
  when you browse down the page.
Navbar position:
  - Top left corner menu, moves into view when you hover over it
Background image:
  - We will use a background image provided by the client that is shown at the top
  of the page when you enter, and as you scroll down to the next section of the
  page, the image is either shaded or tinted so as to change its visibility and
  tell the user that the focus is now elsewhere.

Footer:
  - Google Map
  - Social media (Facebook, Instagram)
