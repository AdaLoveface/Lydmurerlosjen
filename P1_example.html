    <h2> Our Client </h2>


		<ul>
		  <li>Client Name: Nan
		  <li>Contact Person: Geir Henbest
		</ul>
        <p>Our client, Nan Nan, is an artist and we were introduced to her by Geir Henbest,
        an art teacher who teaches at Osaka International School in Japan.
         Geir Henbest met Nan Nan during her time at Myanmar International School,
          and this website will be made as a way of supporting Nan Nan.
           In addition to being an artist, Nan Nan also runs an art school
            for children on the weekends. She sells her artwork in order to
             pay for the rent and for the art assistants helping her at the school.
             Through feedback from both Nan Nan and Geir Henbest, we plan to
              create a website called "Nan Nan Art Studio." </p>

    <h2> Purpose and Goals </h2>
      <p>
        The websiteâ€™s purpose is to spread global awareness of Nan Nanâ€™s life and
		artwork and to inspire people from abroad to help Nan Nan and Myanmar out.
		Thus, our goal is to inform and intrigue users about Nan Nanâ€™s life and
		artwork inspired by Myanmarâ€™s contemporary art forms and culture, through
		a biography about her, a description about Myanmarâ€™s art and materials, a
		gallery of Nan Nanâ€™s art, as well as a description of her art studio. Another
		goal to fulfill such a purpose is to provide users with the opportunity to
		take action, such as donating and volunteering; therefore, we will
		provide contact information, a donation wish list, as well as a volunteer
		form which interested users will be able to fill out. Another goal which
		will be fulfilled by Nan Nan after we have completed our version of the website this
		semester is to sell Nan Nanâ€™s artwork online; with the help of Geir Henbest,
		Nan Nan therefore plans to include backend features in the future.  </p>

    <h2> Audience </h2>
      <p>
       The websiteâ€™s main audience will be those who are interested in learning about the
       work that Nan Nan does. This audience will include those who are interested in
       Myanmar art and  would like to browse through Nan Nanâ€™s gallery for inspiration
       and pleasure. It would also include art teachers and students at Osaka International
       School, who would use the website to learn about Myanmar and receive inspiration
       for their own art project. Finally, it would include potential donors and
       volunteers, who would briefly like to learn about Myanmar and Nan Nanâ€™s life,
       as well as get explicit information about the ways in which they can help. </p>

	This pagewill help us achieve the goal of informing and intriguing users about Nan Nanâ€™s

	simple and easy to read. </li>

    This section will include information about Myanmarâ€™s art and culture, as well as
	unique art materials used, such as South East Asian lacquer, pottery, gold leafs, rubies,
	 gems, teak, and old parts of torn-down buildings. This page will fulfill the goal of
	 informing users about Myanmarâ€™s contemporary art forms and culture. Through detailed
	 descriptions about the art materials used, we plan to create an informative, educational
	page which will help students learn about art from different cultures and which will
	be interesting for those who are interested in Myanmar art. </li>

	which will each have a small caption. The "Designs and Crafts" page will include pictures
	of artwork such as furniture, screens, lamps, jewelry, small beaded animals, craft toys

	school by providing detailed information about the school. Some of the elements we hope
	to include are the school philosophy, a schedule of classes, class offerings, and

	 understanding of the school. </li>

    <h2> Specific Preferences </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Nan Nan would like the website to have a simple, clean look, possibly white
     with a texture. She would like such a background, because too complex of a
      background could potentially detract from the power of the artwork itself.
       She also believes that such a look would be more professional and reflect
       the concept of this website as an artistâ€™s website, more than just an art
       school website which may have a more playful look to it. </li>

	 <li> Nan Nan would like to have her artwork displayed in sections. </li>
	 <li> Nan Nan and Geir Henbest have specifically told us that they would like to
be able to modify the content of the website. Thus, we plan to use Javascript to
write the content.  </li>
	 <li> The content of the website should emphasize the paintings and sculpture. </li>
	 <li> If possible, our client would like to include some content in the local language,
 although this is not a requirement.  </li>

 </ul>
    </section>

    <section>

    <h2> Final Location of the Website </h2>

 	<p> Geir Henbest will donate the domain name and the hosting fees.
 He has informed us that the domain name will eventually be
 www.nannanartstudio.com. </p>
    </section>

	<section>

	<h2> Technical Difficulties </h2>

	<p>We plan to post many pictures in the gallery sections of our website, so we may
	run into the technical problem regarding slowly-loading webpages. Such a website
	will be frustrating for users, so we will need to make sure to avoid such a problem
	by being conscious about the size and number of the photographs we use.
