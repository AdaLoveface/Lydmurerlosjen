    <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to promote the activities of Lydmurerlosjen,
      promote music technology at NTNU as a whole, and presenting past and present students
      and their projects. The audience for this website will be people looking for
      basic information about the union and music technology, with an overview
      of what the union is up to and activities people can join.</p>

    <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>

    <p>The site's navigation structure will be based on a clique structure.
    One will be able to move from anywhere on the site anywhere else, using the
    rollover menu that contains the navbar. The site will, however, function
    inside just one html-file that you also can scroll around in. This is because
    the site does not contain too much information, comes across more as a whole
    presentation and "space" for Lydmurerlosjen, and was wanted by the client.</p>

    <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
    <img src="img/page_universal.png">
    <ul>
      <li>Body width: 80%</li>
      <li>Fonts: Poiret One for navbar and headings. Open Sans for paragraphs
        and everything else</li>

    <li>Color scheme: Each section will have its own color, so that when you are on the home page it
      is a shade of green, and then past projects is red. This will also be reflected
      in the navbar, so when you hover over a specific section in the navbar, it will
      be the same color as the background of that section. So the colors will be:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Home: #3c948b</li>
        <li>About: #3c948b</li>
        <li>Events: #46af69</li>
        <li>Present Projects: #f7d332</li>
        <li>Past Projects: #ffe15b</li>
        <li>Contact: #cc6349</li>
        <li>Other colors</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Navbar/border: #313131</li>
          <li>Shadows: #cecece</li>
          <li>Text 1: #313131</li>
          <li>Text 2: #efefef</li>
          <li>Backgrounds 1: White</li>
          <li>Backgrounds 2: #3c948b</li>
          <li>Banner and footer color: #313131</li>
          <li>Links: blue</li>
          <li>Links when hovered: #bc441c</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    <li>Banner:
      We are considering having a very basic banner, that has a menu button that
      shows the navbar and the Lydmurerlosjen logo.</li>
    <li>Navbar position:
      Top left corner menu, moves into view when you hover over it</li>
    <li>Background image:
      We will use a background image provided by the client that is shown at the top
      of the page when you enter, and as you scroll down to the next section of the
      page, the image is either shaded or tinted so as to change its visibility and
      tell the user that the focus is now elsewhere.</li>

    <li>Footer:
        Social media (Facebook, Instagram)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
      All the content will be in one single html-document, though
      each part can be navigated to through a slide-out sidebar.
    <p>
    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      This section describes what Lydmurerlosjen's purpose is, and who is
      part of the board, possibly with pictures of them and a description
      of what part of the union they are responsible for, and all of their
      email addresses. There will also be a section describing our funding
      partners like SiT.
    </p>

    <h4>Events</h4>
    <p>
      This section describes upcoming events that Lydmurerlosjen will be
      hosting and how you can participate in these events.
      Here we will feature both a JavaScript Google calendar
      containing the events Lydmurerlosjen hosts and a list ver-
      sion of the same calendar. We will also include, if possible, an option
      for the user to add the calendar to her own Google calendar.
    </p>

    <h4>Projects</h4>
    <img src="img/page_projects.png">
    <p>
      Here lies a presentation showcasing the work of
      present and former students, represented with images. When you
      hover over the images they will highlight and their size
      will increase within the box. When you click
      the image it will increase in size and cover most of the screen.
      Underneath there will be some text and embedding of media
      examples and/or link to a home page/facebook page.
      When you click a different icon a new pop-up
      page replaces the former.
    </p>

    <h4>Contact</h4>
    <p>
      This section will have an interactive Google map, a telephone number,
      email address and any other useful info to get in touch with the union.
      There will also be an overview of the board members in
      Lydmurerlosjen with a picture to the left, head liners
      with their position and some information about their
      roles and their email adresses.
    </p>
