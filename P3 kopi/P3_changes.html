    <h1>Changes</h1><br>
    <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
    <p> We have done no changes to the navigation structure of the web page </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Page Layout And Appearance</h2>
    <p>The changing color schemes of the sections were dropped. Instead
      we applied the color changes to the banner. This resulted in the
      effect becoming a little bit more subtle.</p>
    <p>The banner no longer includes a logo, but a simple font which
      we felt was more in line with the overall design philosophy. The
      name of the student organization has also been shifted towards the
      middle of the banner.</p>
    <p>The background image is now only shown at the home section of the
      page. This decision was made based on various experiments with the idea,
      and our conclusion was that it simply didn't look very nice.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>We no longer separate ongoing and finished projects. This decision
    was made because separating it would require us to change the navigation
    interface in one of the sections. Maintaining the simplicity is one of
    our main goals. Additionally, we no longer show the different projects
    as thumbnails under the currently displayed project, as we felt this
    would only clutter the display and take the attention away from the
    project the client is currently reading.</p><br>

    <h2>Contacts</h2>
    <p>The contact list is now displayed as a slide show where the client
    navigates by clicking thumbnails located over the slides.</p><br>

    <h2>Minimum Requirements/which person worked on which file</h2>
    <p>Mats completed on the nav bar changing color in nav bar, Halvor and Magnus
    completed the sidebar scroll navigation, and Ada completed the use of the arrow
    keys to change the slideshow. We worked on a fourth application, that would
    change the color of the sidebar sections when hovered over, but found this
    too difficult for us to complete within the scheduled time, so it was done
    with CSS instead. It is also important to note that everyone worked on the
    website together as a team, mostly in the same room, and that all the applications
    are a result of a team effort.</p><br>


    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    <p>Since the whole website is contained within a single .html-file,
      modularity has not been an issue. We were under the assumption that
      this would not affect our grade.</p>

    <h2>Important note</h2>
    <p>We see that the Google Calendar implementation does not work when the
    website is uploaded to NTNU's servers, and run in Google Chrome. It worked
    fine in the other browsers we tested, and were not able to trouble shoot and
    find out what the problem was.</p>
