    <h2>Purpose and goals of the website</h2>
    <p>
      The goals are to promote the activities of Lydmurerlosjen and also have
      a private part of the website for our existing members to distribute info
      and events.

    <h2>The website's audience</h2>
    <p>
      The audience for this website will be divided in two: people looking for
      basic information about the union and an overview of what the union is up to
      with activities people can join. The other, private part of the website
      is intended for the members of Lydmurerlosjen, where they can discuss
      activities and future plans for the union.
