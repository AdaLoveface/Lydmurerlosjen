      We asked the testers general questions about the site - how it looked, how
      easy or hard the navigation was and the general usability of the site. We
      also gave them specific tasks where they had to find a particular part of
      the website and grade the difficulty of the task.
    </p>

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    <p>We invited the members on the official Music Technologies Facebook
    page to drop by Fjordgata to test our new website, meaning that 100% of the
    test group was college students. We decided to both test the page on single
    individuals and groups of 3. This made us able to simulate different
    scenarios in which people need to access the page. In total, this resulted
    in 17 test groups. Most of the testing was done live, where we saw their reactions,
    asked them to fill out the Google form, and then come with verbal feedback
    for anything that was not covered by the form.
    </p>
    <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
    <p>The website was tested on the following devices</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MacBook Pro, both 13" and 15"</li>
      <li>iMac</li>
      <li>IBM Thinkpad T410s</li>
      <li>iPhone 5, 5s, 6</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The website was tested on the following browsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Chrome</li>
      <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
      <li>Safari</li>
      <li>Opera</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    <p>Overall our testers were very positive to the general design, stating
    that it was a clean and easy design that was easy to navigate.
    However, some of them noted that the "section spacing" had some
    inconsistencies. We also took note of the fact that many of our
    testers did not check out the slide show-functionality. As far
    as we could tell, this was because the functionality didn't
    catch their attention at first (/we pointed it out before they
    left). We were also not quite satisfied with the time it took
    before the testers realised how to navigate the site, which we
    hoped would be in less than 5 seconds after seeing the front page.</p>

    <h2>Our Response to the Feedback</h2>
    <p>Given the feedback we got, we would try to further mark the transitions
    between the sections. We are also thinking of implementing buttons at the
    bottom of the home page which directs the user to the different sections
    in the same way that the nav bar does, as we think this would be an effective
    way to introduce first time viewers to the possibility to scroll through the
    whole website.</p>

    <h2>Self-Reflections</h2>
    <p>Given the feedback we got, we would try to further mark the transitions
    between the sections. We are also thinking of implementing buttons at the
    bottom of the home page which directs the user to the different sections
    in the same way that the nav bar does, as we think this would be an effective
    way to introduce first time viewers to the possibility to scroll through the
    whole website.</p>
    <p>What we learned most of all was the importance of inputs from
    testers. Given that we were to do it all over again, getting a beta
    version out for testing ASAP would be our top priority - the inputs
    we got really cut down the necessary time on polishing-phase, and we
    suspect it would do the same in earlier phases as well. We also found
    that some of our javascript ideas were already available in CSS, and
    implementing them in CSS made the web page more responsive overall.
    When it comes to designing we got a better grasp of what "minimalistic
    design" really means - for the lack of a better way to describe it: It's
    just as much work in deciding how to present what little content there
    is as in deciding what to omit.</p>
